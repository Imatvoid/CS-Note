#### 描述

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.  
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [1,2]  
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.  

#### 中文描述
在一个有序数组中,找出两个数,他们的和是target,返回他们的下标，也要求有序。

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

return [1, 2]
